Hello,

I have finished the initial migration of your data. Please continue reading to get details on how to test the migrated data.

Your migration is not yet complete; the sites are still live at their original location. You will need to take an action in order to complete your migration. If DNS is updated prematurely, a final sync of data may not be possible.

Now is the time for you to inspect your sites to make sure they are working correctly on the new server. The preferred and most accurate method is to modify the hosts file on your home or office computer by entering the new IP for your domain(s).

  GETTING SET UP FOR TESTING:

This tutorial will walk you through the edit of your local hosts file:

I have created a page of the lines you will need to enter into the hosts file on your local computer. That page can be found here: 

 http://${ip}/hostsfile.txt

The process of editing your hosts file is as simple as adding a few lines to a text file through a text editor. This change will tell your browser what IP address you want to load a domain from instead of looking it up from a DNS server. If you have trouble making these changes to test, our Support Team is on hand 24/7 at 800-580-4985 and would be happy to walk you through the process.

I have also created a file on your domains to display if you are resolving to the correct server. The list of those files can be found here:

 http://${ip}/migration_test_urls.html

If you have correctly edited your hosts file you should see a message declaring you are reaching the new server. Please note some sites may use redirects that may not allow our test urls to show correctly. You can still test the actual site in this case. You can also use a browser plugin, such as ShowIP, to tell you the IP address of the site you are visiting, and double confirm that you are reaching the new server.

Using this hosts file method for testing, it will be necessary to clear the cache in your browser before proceeding:

  PERFORMING TESTING:

Once the hosts file is setup, you can go to the site as you normally would to see the site as is on the new server. Please test the functionality of the site and let us know if there are any issues, or if everything is working as expected. As the new server environment is slightly different from the old, some errors are expected during this phase. We are happy to help troubleshoot them on our end. 

Depending on the makeup of your site, you may wish to test the following:

 * The home page and sub pages
 * Logging in
 * Making a post or comment
 * Uploading an image
 * Adding items to the cart and checking out
 * etc.

  TESTING CAVEATS:

Please be advised, while you have the testing entries in your hosts file, email from those domains may not come through to you as normal. Once you remove the entries from your hosts file, you will be able to connect back to the live server and your email will download. Additionally, any automatic SSL ordering mechanisms will not work at this stage, as the sites on the target machine have no live DNS to reference for automatic verification. If enabled, these mechanisms will work only after sites begin to resolve to the new machine. Finally, testing items that depend on 3rd party servers, such as CDNs, mail sending, and payment processing, will likely not work, since public DNS for your sites is still directed towards the origin server.

  ONCE YOU FINISH TESTING:

Once testing is complete, we can schedule a time to do the final sync, at which time, DNS should also be updated; please ensure you have sufficient access to change your DNS records if needed at the final sync. Please also know that we will not automatically terminate the old hosting solution for you; this must be requested separately once you are sure you no longer need the old server.

Since it is ideal to ensure a technician is dedicated to this final sync task, and so that we can start promptly at your desired time, we recommend scheduling a final sync at least 24 hours in advance. Let us know what time works best for you so that we can reserve it on our calendar. If you have any questions please let us know.

Thanks!
