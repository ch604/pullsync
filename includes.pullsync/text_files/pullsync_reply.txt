Hello,

Welcome to the testing phase of the migration process! Please continue reading for important instructions.

Your site is not yet live on your new server. Your action is required before we can complete the migration. Please test and inspect the content of the target server. We want to ensure that your site is working to your specifications. Switching DNS prematurely may prevent a final migration from taking place.

  GETTING SET UP FOR TESTING:

To conduct testing on your target server, please modify the hosts file on your computer. This is the most accurate way to test functionality of the new machine.

These tutorials will walk you through the process of entering the new IP address for your domain(s):

 https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/

You will enter the lines found here: 

 http://${ip}/hostsfile.txt

When your testing is finished, you can follow the same instructions to remove the lines you added to your hosts file.

  PERFORMING TESTING:

Depending on your site, you may wish to test the following:

* Visit each link on your home page and ensure that it loads without error
* If your site runs a CMS such as WordPress or Magento, log into the administrative area
* If your site has a shopping cart, add an item and test your checkout process
* Test any forms on the site
* Create a post
* Comment on a post
* Upload a file

Should you notice any issues when performing the above tests; Don't worry; we are here to help! Provide us with the full URL of the page and the specific error message or problem.

  TESTING CAVEATS:

Please be advised of the following: 

* Email from these domains may not be delivered to you because of the hosts file changes. Once testing is complete, you will be able to connect to the live server to download your email after reverting the changes.
* Automatic SSL ordering mechanisms will not work at this stage because DNS is not live on the target server.
* Testing items that depend on 3rd party servers, such as CDNs, mail sending, and payment processing, will likely not work because of licensing permissions or security features.

  ONCE YOU FINISH TESTING:

Once testing is complete, you may undo the edits you made to your hosts file, and we can then schedule a time to do the final sync, at which time, DNS should also be updated. Please ensure you have sufficient access to change your DNS records if needed at the final sync. Please also know that we will not automatically terminate the old hosting solution for you; this must be requested separately once you are sure you no longer need the old server.

Since it is ideal to ensure a technician is dedicated to this final sync task, and so that we can start promptly at your desired time, we recommend scheduling a final sync at least 24 hours in advance. Let us know what time works best for you so that we can reserve it on our calendar. If you have any questions please let us know.

We will not automatically terminate the old hosting solution; you must request this separately if you no longer need the old server.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks!
