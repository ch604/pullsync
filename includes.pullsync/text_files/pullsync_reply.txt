Hello,

Welcome to the testing phase of the migration process! Please continue reading for important instructions.

Your site is not yet live on your new server. Your action is required before we can complete the migration. Please test and inspect the content of the target server. We want to ensure that your site is working to your specifications. Switching DNS prematurely may prevent a final migration from taking place.

  GETTING SET UP FOR TESTING:

To conduct testing on your target server, please modify the hosts file on your computer. This is the most accurate way to test functionality of the new machine.

These tutorials will walk you through the process of entering the new IP address for your domain(s):

 https://liquidweb.com/kb/dns-hosts-file/
 https://liquidweb.com/kb/edit-host-file-windows-10/

You will enter the lines found here: 

 http://${ip}/hostsfile.txt

Browser cache must be cleared before proceeding:

If you have trouble making these changes, our Support Team is on hand 24/7 at 800-580-4985 and would be happy to walk you through the process. When your testing is finished, you can follow the same instructions to remove the lines you added to your hosts file.

  PERFORMING TESTING:

Depending on your site, you may wish to test the following:

* Visit each link on your home page and ensure that it loads without error
* If your site runs a CMS such as WordPress or Magento, log into the administrative area
* If your site has a shopping cart, add an item and test your checkout process
* Test any forms on the site
* Create a post
* Comment on a post
* Upload a file

Should you notice any issues when performing the above tests; Don't worry; we are here to help!  Provide us with the full URL of the page and the specific error message or problem.

  TESTING CAVEATS:

Please be advised of the following: 

* Email from these domains may not be delivered. Once testing is complete, you will be able to connect to the live server to download your email.
* Automatic SSL ordering mechanisms will not work at this stage.
* Testing items that depend on 3rd party servers, such as CDNs, mail sending, and payment processing, will likely not work.

  ONCE YOU FINISH TESTING:

Please advise us when your testing is complete and we will schedule the final sync. Let us know what time works best for you so we can reserve it on our calendar. We dedicate a technician to this process, so please provide at least 24 hours' notice.

While the final sync is in progress we will change the DNS zone files on your old server to point to your new server (if the DNS is hosted locally).

Once the final sync is complete, we will ask you to change your DNS name server IPs at your registrar (if applicable) along with any remote DNS, and the migration will be complete.

We will not automatically terminate the old hosting solution; you must request this separately if you no longer need the old server.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks!
